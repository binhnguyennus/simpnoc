## Simple Network-on-Chip

This is an  implementation of a simplistic but paramaeterizable Network-on-Chip with buffered sources, sinks and routers. The network was tested and functions correctly on Altera's DE1 and DE2 boards (using Altera Cyclone II 2C20 and Cyclone IV 4CE115 FPGAs respectively).

The implementation was used to develop the dynamic thermal-aware routing strategies proposed in [1].
