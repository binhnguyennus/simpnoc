Simple Network-on-Chip
======================

This is a simplistic implementation of a paramaeterizable Network-on-Chip with buffered sources, sinks and routers. The network has been tested in and functions correctly on Altera's DE1 and DE2 boards (using Altera Cyclone® II 2C20 FPGA and Cyclone® IV 4CE115 FPGAs respectively).

The implementation was used to investigate the dynamic thermal-aware routing strategies proposed in [1].
